Hypothesis:

general hypothesis on data:

- If the sqm rise, the price will rise
- waterfront houses will have higher prices then without waterfront
- better view means higher prices
- better condition means higher prices
- recently renovated will mean higher prices
- there are seasonal changes is the pricing level


assumptions to stakeholder: 

- buying time need to be flexible throughout the year
- required bedrooms: 3 - 6 
- required space: follow WHO recommendation
- nice/social neighborhood: based on gentrification maps, find zip codes with nice neighborhoods
- budget: lower 15 percent of prices, find price limit


hypothesis:

- bad condition, low grade, either central 'bad' neigborhood or far outskirts
- there are no affordable houses with sufficient bedroom numbers in nice neighborhoods
- might suggest to buy more sqft but few bedrooms and construct separating walls (WHO recommendation)
